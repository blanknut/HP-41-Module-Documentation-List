# HP-41 Module Documentation List

A whole bunch of modules were created for the Hewlett-Packard Series 41 pocket calculator. Since the release of the amazing [HP-41CL](https://www.systemyde.com/hp41/index.html) calculator, many of them are available at your fingertips. However, after so many years, there is a lack of documentation. This file is an attempt to collect documentation pointers for the HP-41 modules available in the HP-41CL. Contributers are welcome!

This file will be included in the [41CL Image Identifiers](https://calc.fjk.ch/db/sy41cl/sy41cl-image-identifiers.html) Web Page that I'm hosting and maintaining.
